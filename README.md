# SpatialApplication

An Oculus Quest application to facilitate an experiment into how users spatially arrange documents in 3D space for augmented reality, simulated in VR.

Please note the User ID displayed at the end of the experiment (on the monitor), this will be an 8-digit value. After completing the experiment please fill in this questionnaire: https://tinyurl.com/y5m4b4n3.

**Purpose of Study**

The purpose of the study is to improve our understanding of the way people spatially arrange and group documents in space.

The scenario for this experiment is to allow users to arrange and group electronic mail in three dimensions. There will also be the option to colour code documents as a secondary means to impart groupings of documents. A virtual reality headset is used to present an augmented reality environment to users without access to head-mounted augmented reality hardware.

**Participation**

Your participation in this experiment is voluntary and you may choose to stop at any time and remove yourself from the study. If you feel nauseous at any time while wearing the virtual reality headset, remove the headset.

**Researcher Contact**

Please contact the researcher by email at v012065@northumbria.ac.uk if you have any questions about the experiment or wish to withdraw from the study. You will only be contacted by the researcher by email (if provided) and in relation to the study or if you want additional details on the study or results.

**Experimental Procedure**

The participant will be presented with a virtual desk with a monitor in an office environment and must first put on the virtual "AR glasses" on the desk by picking them up and moving them to their head. The application will guide through the experimental procedure within the headset.

The participant will then need to consent to data collection and begin the experiment by pressing a virtual button. They will then see a set of cubes and a disk appear on the desk. When they pick them up (they can grab them using the controllers, shown as a virtual hand) and move them off the table the cubes will become full sized email documents. Documents will stay visible as long as they are held, or a hand is touching. If the documents are released, they will stay in place and become cubes again until the participant places a hand within the cube. 

There is also a virtual monitor with a button to open a colouring pallet. This can be used to colour the cubes a chosen colour by picking up and moving a virtual brush over the desired colour and then into a cube. The participant will be able to place the cubes in space and colour code them as desired. They will need to group them however they feel by the groupings of VR/AR, AI, Teaching and Spam. The experiment will be finished by inserting a disk into a computer under the desk, which will trigger collected data to be uploaded and a copy saved to the Quest.

Once complete the participant will (hopefully) fill in some questionnaires.

**Collected Data**

Each participant will be given a User ID at the end of the experiment. This User ID will then be used for identification of data and questionnaires. Participants can also use this User ID in case they later want to leave the experiment. Participant’s personal information will not be part of any published data set and will instead be anonymised using the User ID.

The final layout and colour of documents will be recorded and uploaded to a secure server.

Data collected will be used to produce a series of metrics to better understand and to establish any difference between different arrangements of documents in augmented reality 3D space.

Data collected will be stored securely on a server under control of the researchers, data may then be copied to a hard drive or USB stick for the purposes of analysis and will only be retained as long as required. The server and drive will only be accessible to the researcher(s) required to process the data and will be kept password protected. The data will be kept by the researcher/project consultants until the end of the project. They will then be disposed of in line with Northumbria University’s retention policy as data controller under the General Data Protection Regulation (GPDR). Results may be published in a peer-reviewed journal or conference proceedings and may be used as part of the researcher’s thesis.
